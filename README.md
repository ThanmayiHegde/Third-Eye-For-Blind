# Third-Eye-For-Blind
Third eye for people who are blind is an innovation which helps the blind people to navigate with speed and confidence by detecting the nearby obstacles using the help of ultrasonic waves and notify them with buzzer sound or vibration.

The aim of the project is to develop more efficient way to
help visually impaired to navigate with greater comfort, speed and
confidence.

This device will help the blind to navigate without holding a stick which
is a bit annoying for them. They can simply wear it as a band or cloth
and it can function very accurately and they only need a very little
training to use it.
