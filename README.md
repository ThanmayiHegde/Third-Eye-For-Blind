# Third-Eye-For-Blind
Third eye for people who are blind is an innovation which helps the blind people to navigate with speed and confidence by detecting the nearby obstacles using the help of ultrasonic waves and notify them with buzzer sound or vibration.

* The aim of the project is to develop more efficient way to
help visually impaired to navigate with greater comfort, speed and
confidence.

* This device will help the blind to navigate without holding a stick which
is a bit annoying for them. They can simply wear it as a band or cloth
and it can function very accurately and they only need a very little
training to use it.

# COMPONENTS REQUIRED :
1) Arduino Nano
2) Ultrasonic Sensors HC-SR04
3) Breadboard
4) Vibrating Motor
5) Buzzer
6) 5 mm LED: red
7) Slide Switch
8) Female header 8 position 1 row (0.1’’)
9) Male header 40 position 1 row (0.1’’)
10) Jumper wires
11) Power Bank
12) 3.7 V LiPo Battery

# SCOPE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT: 
•	To make system that are interfaced with some smart functioned equipment’s like glove, head-gear and multiple distance meter.   
•	Whenever the obstacle is detected on the way through, ultra-sonic sensor placed on these equipment’s identify the type of the object and then it is intimated as voice command through buzzer connected with ARDUINO. So that blind can able to identify the object in-front of them. 
•	Ultrasonic glove is designed to help the visually impaired people which could be worn on their palm, shoulders, wrist and legs to help them in identifying the obstacles toward which they are a heading and make decision based on their need. 
•	Ultrasonic head-gear are designed such that they help blind by preventing them from cracking their heads on to the obstacle. This is designed ensure stupendous experience to the user.   
•	Ultrasonic multiple distance meter could be installed onto door head jambs, on cupboard doors, trunk of cars so that it makes the earsplitting sound from the buzzers, notifying the user about the impact of his actions. 
•	To develop a Kit for visually impaired people so that it helps them in getting out through Ommetaphobia and try being one among all. 

# SYSTEM DESIGN OF THE PROJECT: 
ARDUINO: There are two required functions in an Arduino sketch, setup() and loop().Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.  
HC-SR04 ULTRASONIC SENSOR MODULE: The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance 
Sensor is a sensor used for detecting the distance to an object using sonar. It's ideal for any robotics projects you have which require you to avoid objects, by detecting how close they are you can steer away from them.
C/C++: The code for Arduino board interface is written in C or C++. 
PIEZO BUZZER: A piezo buzzer works by applying an alternating voltage to the piezoelectric ceramic material. The introduction of such an input signal causes the piezoceramic to vibrate rapidly, resulting in the generation of sound waves
